I'm a postdoc with Andrey Rzhetsky at the [Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology](http://igsb.org). My doctoral work was in Columbia University's departments of [Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu) and [Systems Biology](https://systemsbiology.columbia.edu), (see [CV](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10824188/melamed_CV.pdf))

My recent work has aimed at finding patterns across compendiums of genomic and clinical data about cancer patients. 
This includes discovering how mutations causing Mendelian diseases could have hidden roles in cancer ([press](http://bit.ly/1DPDtrc), [paper](http://bit.ly/1QUtB8s)), and finding combinations of genetic alterations across tumor cohorts ([paper](http://bit.ly/1CEEWWF)).  
Currently, we are combining models of cancer mechanisms with genomic data to identify targetable cellular processes in cancer.
